0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest possible word loaded from the dictionary. It was invented by 
    the president of the National Puzzlers' League and is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary. 
1.  returns the resource useage of the "who" argument.
2.  16
3.  Because getrusage returns resource usage in the structure pointed to by the struct rusage *usage argument. we need to pass calculate 
    the address of before and after so that the calculations can be performed. 
4.  Main uses a for-lop with fgetc to read a file stream character by character until it reaches the end of the file. 
    The loop starts with initializing the varaible 'c' to get the first character from the file stream. The loop will 
    continue to receive characters from the file stream until it reachs the end of the file. Inside the loop, each char is checked
    whether it is an alpha-character/apostrophie, numeric, or longer than the maximium sized word. If the word contains an alpha character 
    or is too long, the word is continued to be read through program until end of word is reached and the loop moves on to the next word. 
    Each time it cycles through the conditions, the loop is incremented by getting the next character from the file stream.
5.  fscanf reads whole strings and doesn't keep track of each character read like fgetc does. If we 
    gave fscanf a word greater than the max length it could overwrite memory unintentionally or cause a seg fault.
6.  We declare load and check using constant pointers so that they cannot be made to point at any other data.
