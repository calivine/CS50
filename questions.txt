1.  stdint.h is a c standard library that provides code to typedefs that can specify exact-width integer types. 
2.  using an exact-width integer type is useful for embedded programming or hardware manipulation that required exact widths and placement of bytes. 
3.  BYTE = 1 byte. DWORD = 4 bytes. LONG = 4 bytes. WORD = 2 bytes.
4.  first two bytes of  BMP file are bfType, which refers to the file type, must be BM.
5.  bfSize, is the size in bytes of the bitmap file. biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  It could return NULL if one of the files is the incorrect type, or the computer is out of memory. 
9.  so that fread only reads one element at a time. 
10. 3
11. fseek moves a position indicator in a stream a certain number of bytes relaitve to whence. This allows us to move our position in a file. 
12. offset is relative to the current position indicator.
